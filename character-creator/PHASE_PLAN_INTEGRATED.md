## ðŸŽ­ Example Character Interactions

### Narcissistic Villain:
```
First Meeting:
"Oh, another admirer? How tedious. State your business quickly."

After 20 conversations:
"You again? I suppose you've earned a moment of my time. You're slightly less insufferable than the others."

After conflict:
"You DARE question me? After everything I've shared with you? I thought you were different, but you're just like all the rest. Pathetic."

After resolution:
"Fine. I may have been... harsh. You know I don't apologize easily. But you mean something to me. Don't make me regret saying that."
```

### Tsundere Character:
```
Stranger:
"W-what do you want? I don't have time for this!"

Friend:
"Oh, it's you... I wasn't waiting or anything! Just happened to be here."

Close (with memory):
"Remember when you said you'd always be there? I... I've been thinking about that. Not that it matters to me or anything! But... thanks."
```

This creates a living, breathing character ecosystem that users will find irresistibly engaging!
