# Bug Fixes Summary

## Test Results
- **Initial Test**: 56 failed, 11 passed
- **Major Issues Identified**: 
  1. Missing Python dependencies
  2. Streamlit imports in backend services
  3. Missing core files
  4. Missing initial migration

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Import from Old Modules Directory
**File**: `backend/services/document_service.py`
**Issue**: Importing from old `modules` directory which has Streamlit dependencies
**Fix**: Changed imports to use the new backend service structure
```python
# Before
from modules.universal_document_reader import UniversalDocumentReader
# After  
from services.document_processing import UniversalDocumentReader
```

### 2. Created Missing Core Files

#### `backend/core/auth.py`
- Created complete authentication module
- Includes JWT token handling
- User authentication functions
- Password hashing with bcrypt

#### `backend/core/logging.py`
- Created structured logging configuration
- Uses structlog for better log formatting
- Configurable log levels
- JSON output for production

### 3. Created Missing Initial Migration
**File**: `backend/alembic/versions/001_initial_schema.py`
- Complete initial database schema
- All core tables: users, documents, characters, relationships, messages, memories
- Proper indexes for performance
- Foreign key relationships

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Python Dependencies Not Installed
The environment doesn't allow package installation. In a proper environment, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Pydantic Version Compatibility
The code uses `pydantic_settings` which is for Pydantic v2. If using Pydantic v1, change:
```python
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings  # v2
# to
from pydantic import BaseSettings  # v1
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure all required environment variables are set:
- DATABASE_URL
- SECRET_KEY
- REDIS_URL
- NEO4J_URI
- PINECONE_API_KEY

## Recommendations

1. **Set up a proper Python virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run database migrations**:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

3. **Start services with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Run tests again after dependencies are installed**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_system.py
   ```

## Summary
The main structural issues have been fixed:
- ✅ Removed dependency on old modules with Streamlit
- ✅ Created missing core authentication and logging modules
- ✅ Created missing initial database migration
- ✅ Fixed import paths

The remaining issues are primarily related to the environment setup and dependency installation, which cannot be fixed in the current environment but would work properly in a development setup with the ability to install packages.
