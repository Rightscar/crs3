## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Data Loss**: Implement backups before any changes
2. **Breaking Changes**: Use feature flags for gradual rollout
3. **Performance Degradation**: Benchmark before/after changes
4. **User Disruption**: Maintain backward compatibility

### Mitigation Approaches
- Create rollback plan for each phase
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Use staging environment for testing
- Create automated regression tests
