# Runtime Errors Fixed for Render Deployment

## Summary
This document lists all runtime errors that were fixed to ensure successful deployment on Render.

## 1. Authentication Session State Error
**Error**: `AttributeError: st.session_state has no attribute "authenticated"`
**Cause**: Session state wasn't initialized before being accessed
**Fix**: 
- Added `_init_session_state()` calls in `is_authenticated()` and `require_auth()` methods
- Implemented lazy loading for auth_manager

## 2. Database Path Validation Error
**Error**: `RuntimeError: Database initialization failed: Database path must be within safe directories`
**Cause**: Path validation logic was too strict for Render's `/tmp` directory
**Fix**: 
- Improved path normalization using `os.path.normpath()`
- Added special handling for Render environment
- Enhanced error logging for debugging

## 3. Missing UUID Import Error
**Error**: `name 'uuid' is not defined` in multi_format_exporter.py
**Cause**: Missing import statement
**Fix**: Added `import uuid` to the imports section

## 4. Global Manager Instantiation Errors
**Error**: Various managers trying to initialize at module import time before dependencies are ready
**Cause**: Global instances created at module level
**Fix**: Converted to lazy initialization pattern for:
- IntegrationManager
- FileStorageManager
- AsyncSessionManager
- EditModeManager
- UIStateManager

## 5. OPTIONAL_MODULES Undefined Error
**Error**: `Error loading CSS: name 'OPTIONAL_MODULES' is not defined`
**Cause**: CSS loading code was executed before OPTIONAL_MODULES was initialized
**Fix**: Moved CSS loading code after module initialization

## 6. Lazy Initialization Still Calling at Import Time
**Error**: Managers were still being instantiated at import time despite lazy initialization
**Cause**: `integration_manager = get_integration_manager()` was called at module level
**Fix**: Created proxy objects that defer actual instantiation until first use

## 7. Python Version and Package Compatibility
**Previously Fixed Issues**:
- pandas 2.1.4 → 2.2.3 (Python 3.12 compatibility)
- numpy 1.26.2 → 1.26.4
- ebooklib 0.18 → 0.19
- langdetect/langid → charset-normalizer (avoiding numpy conflicts)
- python-magic → puremagic (pure Python alternative)
- torch 2.1.2 → 2.2.0
- tiktoken 0.5.2 → 0.6.0
- lxml 4.9.4 → 5.2.2
- psutil 5.9.8 → 6.0.0
- celery 5.3.4 → 5.3.6

## 8. Streamlit Configuration Errors
**Previously Fixed Issues**:
- Removed deprecated options from `.streamlit/config.toml`
- Fixed `scripts/render_config.py` to stop overwriting config
- Disabled `buildCommand` in `render.yaml`

## Default Credentials
- Username: `demo`, Password: `demo123`
- Username: `admin`, Password: `admin123`

## Deployment Notes
- Database uses `/tmp/universal_reader.db` on Render (ephemeral)
- For production, consider using PostgreSQL or other persistent storage
- Set `APP_USERS` environment variable for custom authentication
