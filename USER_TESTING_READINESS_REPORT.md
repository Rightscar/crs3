## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES (NON-BLOCKING)

1. **Limited PDF Features:** Without PyMuPDF, PDF rendering is basic
2. **Basic NLP:** Without spaCy, advanced NLP features are simplified
3. **Demo Mode:** Without OpenAI API key, AI features use demo responses

**These issues DO NOT block user testing** as the application has fallback modes.

---

## 📋 EMERGENCY CONTACT & ROLLBACK

### If Critical Issues Found During Testing:

1. **Immediate Action:** Stop user testing
2. **Diagnostic:** Run `python3 tests/test_user_breaking_scenarios.py`
3. **Log Collection:** Check application logs for errors
4. **Rollback Plan:** Revert to previous stable version if needed

### Monitoring During Testing:
- **CPU Usage:** Should stay < 80%
- **Memory Usage:** Should stay < 1GB
- **Error Rate:** Should be < 1%
- **Response Time:** Should be < 10 seconds
