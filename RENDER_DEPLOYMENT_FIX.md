# Render Deployment Fix Summary

## Problem
The deployment was failing with the error:
```
pandas/_libs/tslibs/base.cpython-313-x86_64-linux-gnu.so.p/pandas/_libs/tslibs/base.pyx.c:5397:27: error: too few arguments to function '_PyLong_AsByteArray'
```

This occurred because:
1. Render was using Python 3.13.4 by default (as of June 2025)
2. Pandas 2.1.4 is not compatible with Python 3.13
3. The build process was trying to compile pandas from source, which failed due to API changes in Python 3.13

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Python Version
- Changed from Python 3.11 to Python 3.12 in the Dockerfile
- Updated the PYTHON_VERSION environment variable in render.yaml to "3.12"
- Created a `.python-version` file specifying 3.12.9 (though this is not used with Docker runtime)

### 2. Updated Dependencies
- Updated pandas from 2.1.4 to 2.2.3 (first version with Python 3.13 support)
- Updated numpy from 1.26.2 to 1.26.4 for better compatibility

### 3. Cleaned Up Configuration
- Removed `runtime.txt` as Render doesn't use this file
- Removed spacy model download from Dockerfile as spacy is not in requirements.txt

## Files Modified
1. `Dockerfile` - Updated base image to `python:3.12-slim`
2. `render.yaml` - Updated PYTHON_VERSION to "3.12"
3. `requirements.txt` - Updated pandas to 2.2.3 and numpy to 1.26.4
4. `.python-version` - Created with Python 3.12.9
5. `runtime.txt` - Deleted (not used by Render)

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Push to GitHub
3. Trigger a new deployment on Render
4. The build should now complete successfully

## Alternative Solutions
If you prefer to use Python 3.13:
- Ensure pandas >= 2.2.3 is used
- Be aware that Python 3.13.4 has some regressions; consider using 3.13.5 when available

## Notes
- Since you're using Docker runtime, the Python version is controlled by the Dockerfile
- The `.python-version` file is included for completeness but won't affect Docker deployments
- Consider testing locally with Docker: `docker build -t crs3-test . && docker run -p 8501:8501 crs3-test`
