# Python 3.12 Package Compatibility Issues

This document lists all packages in requirements.txt that may have build or compatibility issues with Python 3.12.

## Packages Fixed

### 1. **tiktoken==0.5.2** → **0.6.0** ✅
- **Issue**: Requires compilation and may have build issues with Python 3.12
- **Solution**: Updated to version 0.6.0 which has pre-built wheels for Python 3.12

### 2. **lxml==4.9.4** → **5.2.2** ✅
- **Issue**: C extension that requires compilation, may have issues with Python 3.12's C API changes
- **Solution**: Updated to version 5.2.2 which has better Python 3.12 support

### 3. **langdetect==1.0.9** → **langid==1.1.6** → **py3langid==0.3.0** ✅
- **Issue**: langdetect and langid both have build issues with Python 3.12
- **Solution**: Replaced with py3langid==0.3.0, a modernized fork that's faster and Python 3.12 compatible

### 4. **python-magic==0.4.27** → **puremagic==1.28** ✅
- **Issue**: Last updated in June 2022, doesn't list Python 3.12 support, requires libmagic system library
- **Solution**: Replaced with puremagic==1.28, a pure Python alternative with no external dependencies

### 5. **psutil==5.9.8** → **6.0.0** ✅
- **Issue**: C extension that may need recompilation for Python 3.12
- **Solution**: Updated to version 6.0.0 which has Python 3.12 wheels

### 6. **celery==5.3.4** → **5.3.6** ✅
- **Issue**: Has issues with Python 3.12 mock assertions and deprecated features
- **Solution**: Updated to version 5.3.6 which has Python 3.12 fixes

### 7. **pandas==2.1.4** → **2.2.3** ✅ (Already fixed)
- **Issue**: Not compatible with Python 3.12 due to C API changes
- **Solution**: Already updated to 2.2.3

### 8. **numpy==1.26.2** → **1.26.4** ✅ (Already fixed)
- **Issue**: Compatibility issues with Python 3.12
- **Solution**: Already updated to 1.26.4

### 9. **ebooklib==0.18** → **0.19** ✅ (Already fixed)
- **Issue**: Build issues with setup.py
- **Solution**: Already updated to 0.19

## Package Replacements Summary

| Old Package | New Package | Reason |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| langdetect/langid | py3langid==0.3.0 | Pure Python, faster, Python 3.12 compatible |
| python-magic==0.4.27 | puremagic==1.28 | Pure Python, no external dependencies |

## Code Changes Required

### 1. Language Detection
If your code uses langid, update the import:
```python
# Old:
import langid

# New:
import py3langid as langid
```

### 2. File Type Detection
If your code uses python-magic, replace with puremagic:
```python
# Old:
import magic
file_type = magic.from_file(filename)

# New:
import puremagic
file_type = puremagic.from_file(filename)
```

## Docker Changes

The Dockerfile has been updated to:
1. Use Python 3.12-slim base image
2. Add build-essential and python3-dev for compilation support
3. Add libxml2-dev and libxslt-dev for lxml
4. Remove libmagic1 (no longer needed with puremagic)

## Testing

After deployment, verify:
1. All packages install successfully
2. Language detection works with py3langid
3. File type detection works with puremagic (if used)
4. All other functionality remains intact

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Faster installation**: Pre-built wheels and pure Python packages install faster
2. **No system dependencies**: puremagic doesn't require libmagic
3. **Better performance**: py3langid is 5-6x faster than langid
4. **Future-proof**: All packages now officially support Python 3.12

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can rollback to Python 3.11 by:
1. Changing the Dockerfile base image to `python:3.11-slim`
2. Reverting the package versions in requirements.txt
3. Re-deploying the application
