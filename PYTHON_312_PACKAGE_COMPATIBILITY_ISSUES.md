# Python 3.12 Package Compatibility Issues

This document lists all packages in requirements.txt that may have build or compatibility issues with Python 3.12.

## Packages Fixed

### 1. **tiktoken==0.5.2** → **0.6.0** ✅
- **Issue**: Requires compilation and may have build issues with Python 3.12
- **Solution**: Updated to version 0.6.0 which has pre-built wheels for Python 3.12

### 2. **lxml==4.9.4** → **5.2.2** ✅
- **Issue**: C extension that requires compilation, may have issues with Python 3.12's C API changes
- **Solution**: Updated to version 5.2.2 which has better Python 3.12 support

### 3. **langdetect==1.0.9** → **charset-normalizer** ✅
- **Issue**: langdetect and langid both have build issues with Python 3.12
- **Solution**: Using charset-normalizer (already a dependency of requests) which has language detection capabilities and is pure Python

### 4. **python-magic==0.4.27** → **puremagic==1.28** ✅
- **Issue**: python-magic requires libmagic system library which can cause deployment issues
- **Solution**: Replaced with puremagic==1.28, a pure Python alternative

### 5. **ebooklib==0.18** → **0.19** ✅
- **Issue**: Old package with build issues on Python 3.12
- **Solution**: Updated to version 0.19 which has better packaging

### 6. **pandas==2.1.4** → **2.2.3** ✅
- **Issue**: pandas 2.1.4 is not compatible with Python 3.13 (Render's default)
- **Solution**: Updated to version 2.2.3 which supports Python 3.12 and 3.13

### 7. **numpy==1.26.2** → **1.26.4** ✅
- **Issue**: Compatibility with pandas and Python 3.12
- **Solution**: Updated to version 1.26.4

### 8. **psutil==5.9.8** → **6.0.0** ✅
- **Issue**: May have issues with Python 3.12
- **Solution**: Updated to version 6.0.0 which has full Python 3.12 support

### 9. **celery==5.3.4** → **5.3.6** ✅
- **Issue**: Potential compatibility issues with Python 3.12
- **Solution**: Updated to version 5.3.6

### 10. **torch==2.1.2** → **2.2.0** ✅
- **Issue**: PyTorch 2.1.2 doesn't support Python 3.12
- **Solution**: Updated to version 2.2.0 which is the minimum version with Python 3.12 support

## Implementation Details

### Language Detection with charset-normalizer
Since charset-normalizer is already a dependency of the requests library, we can use it for language detection without adding extra dependencies:

```python
from charset_normalizer import from_bytes

# Detect language
result = from_bytes(text.encode('utf-8'))
if result.best() and result.best().language:
    detected_language = result.best().language.lower()
```

### Dockerfile Updates
The Dockerfile has been updated to:
- Use Python 3.12-slim base image
- Include necessary build dependencies (python3-dev, libxml2-dev, libxslt-dev)
- Remove libmagic1 since we're using puremagic

## Summary
All packages with Python 3.12 compatibility issues have been addressed by either:
1. Updating to newer versions with Python 3.12 support
2. Replacing with pure Python alternatives
3. Using existing dependencies for functionality (charset-normalizer for language detection)

This ensures smooth deployment on Python 3.12 environments without build or runtime issues.
