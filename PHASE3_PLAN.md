## Technical Implementation Details

### Character Evolution Database Schema
```sql
-- Evolution tracking
CREATE TABLE character_evolution (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    character_id UUID REFERENCES characters(id),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    trait_changes JSONB,
    trigger_event TEXT,
    user_influence FLOAT
);

-- Relationship progression
CREATE TABLE character_relationships (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    character_id UUID REFERENCES characters(id),
    user_id UUID,
    relationship_level INT,
    trust_score FLOAT,
    shared_secrets JSONB,
    unlocked_content JSONB
);

-- Multi-character interactions
CREATE TABLE character_interactions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    character1_id UUID REFERENCES characters(id),
    character2_id UUID REFERENCES characters(id),
    interaction_type TEXT,
    outcome JSONB,
    story_impact FLOAT
);
```

### Character Fusion Algorithm
```python
def fuse_characters(char1: Character, char2: Character, fusion_params: Dict):
    """
    Fuse two characters into a hybrid
    
    Fusion formula:
    - Personality: Weighted average with conflict resolution
    - Memories: Selective merge based on importance
    - Speech: Pattern blending with uniqueness preservation
    - Appearance: Creative combination
    """
